# Workflow: Merge Conflict Detection
# Purpose:
#   Prevents merging a PR that contains unresolved merge conflicts with the base branch.
#   This workflow performs a no-commit merge attempt against the latest version of the
#   base branch (usually 'main'). If a conflict is detected, the workflow fails and blocks the merge.
#   Ensures that reviewers only see conflict-free PRs and protects the stability of 'main'.
